# joomla-civicrm-css-class-plugin

Joomla plugin that allows CiviCRM to add a CSS class attribute to the &lt;body> tag.

This is just a quick attempt to see if a Joomla plugin could get the CiviCRM Shoreditch to work on Joomla. There are still many places where styling isn't applied correctly but this plugin at least gets some of the main pages working.

Idea is from: https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/300
Also see: https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.shoreditch/issues/238

Why the body and not .crm-container? See https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.shoreditch/issues/136

The plugin would be installed in the standard Joomla manner. For example download the files and put them in zip file (at the top level, not within a folder) and Extensions > Manage > Install, then Upload Package File.
